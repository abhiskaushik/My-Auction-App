1.  Front End look is like shown in Image:
2. I am mentioning the backend mechanism we will be using for them.
      a.  All the images in LABEL A (players img) will be retrieved on client side using jquery or from            server side using sockets.(depending upon which preloading speed).
      b. TEAM-BID TABLE
           1. it will be dynamic for current bidding player. Say Dhoni is bieng bid, all bids of a paticular                      team would be displayed in their bid row. We will also store the bids of all team for a each                   player in our Database. It will be done using socket.io from node server.
           2. After a bid is complete (say after 5 mins,if bidding for one player continues for 5 min) , all                      the rows will be set to initial i.e blank.
3. CURRENT BID
      Whoever enters bid  & presses enter, the team name and their bid price would appear here 
     if entered price is highest of all. (using SOCKET)

4.PLAYER STATS
      for every player stats figure will be stored in an array on server and we will fetch it alongwith      the player image.(using socket).

5.YOUR TEAM
     If your BID is the highest  till end of time your player will be appenede in your team BOX.
